> We expect that broadly accepted community guidelines and standardized metrics will enhance rigor, data quality and alignment between laboratories.

[The *Nature Methods* white paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01785-3) proposed best practices, quality controls and data-reporting recommendations to assist in the broad adoption of reliable quantitative workflows for single-cell proteomics.
